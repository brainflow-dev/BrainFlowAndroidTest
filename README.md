### [BrainFlow Android Dev and User Guides](https://brainflow.ai/get_started/?platform=android&language=java&manufactorer=openbci&board=wifi-shield&)

Currently it supports:

* Synthetic Board
* OpenBCI Ganglion + WIFI Shield
* OpenBCI Cyton + WIFI Shield
* OpenBCI Cyton Daisy + WIFI Shield

BrainFlow may work on Android for other devices as well without any changes, but so far on Android we tested only devices above.

### Limitations in Android Emulator

It's hard to configure Android Emulator to work with real boards, so in Android Emulator we recommend to use Synthetic Board and test real boards directly on real Android Device
